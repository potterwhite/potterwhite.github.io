Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.\nWhy do I want it? Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:\nWhat is it good for?: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?\nWhat is it not good for?: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren't for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.\nWhat is it not yet good for?: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.\nWhere should I go next?

Think of your tasks pages as a cookbook with different procedures your users can combine to create something more substantial.\nYou can give each task a page, or you can group related tasks together in a page, such as tasks related to a particular feature. As well as grouping related tasks in single pages, you can also group task pages in nested folders with an index page as an overview, as seen in this example site. Or if you have a small docset like the Docsy User Guide with no Tutorials or Concepts pages, consider adding your feature-specific pages at the top level of your docs rather than in a Tasks section.\nEach task should give the user\nThe prerequisites for this task, if any (this can be specified at the top of a multi-task page if they're the same for all the page's tasks. \"All these tasks assume that you understand....and that you have already....\").

You can use the guidelines \"as is\" or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project's file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon't forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\nWe use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here's a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you're familiar with the GitHub workflow and you're happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\nFork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you're not yet ready for a review, add \"WIP\" to the PR name to indicate it's a work in progress. (Don't add the Hugo property \"draft = true\" to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it's ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of \"Deploy preview ready\" to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with the content. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any \"WIP\" markers. Updating a single page If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\nClick Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes. Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\nFollow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You'll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\nFork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\n$$git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git$$ Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you're serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\nContinue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\nCreating an issue If you've found a problem in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

重要记录：\nHDR 8K 虚拟人物-虚幻引擎 SDI将会被淘汰，IP流传输会取而代之 如果按照原有的传输方式，为了满足 4K 大约需要 8G-9G 的传输带宽，原有的 3G SDI 线要么 4 根达到 12G 带宽， 要么就换成 12G 的 SDI 传输方式，但这两个各有弊端。 首先为了实现 4K 传输，所使用的传输线需要是原来的 14 倍，组网复杂、成本高昂； 如果换成 12G SDI，由于高速信号在 SDI 铜缆的传输中，传输距离跟速率是成反比的， 大概只能达到 50 米的传输距离，远远不能满足广电行业的视频传输需要。 如果未来传输 8K 的话，要求最低 25G-30G、最高 140G 的带宽，已经不是现有 SDI 的传输方式能够解决的。 高性能硬件就成为了迈向超高清视频的必经之路。 “视频行业从 SDI 走向 IP 成为大势所趋”，陈龙谈到，“以数据中心的 IP 解决方案为例， 整个数据中心带宽已经一跃到现在的 400G，不仅成本上比现有的定制化 SDI 更低，带宽也提升了。 不过切换到 IP 传输方案上，在带宽问题解决的同时，也付出一定的代价。 因为需要在一个厚重的网络协议栈上处理，给终端 CPU 负载带来很大的压力。 这里所说的，4K需要8~9Gbps的带宽需求，我这里做了一点计算。\n计算4K或8K分辨率视频所需的带宽涉及几个关键因素，包括视频分辨率、帧率、颜色深度、颜色子采样、以及是否使用HDR（高动态范围）或SDR（标准动态范围）。以下是详细的计算过程。\n1. 分辨率 4K分辨率：3840 x 2160 像素 8K分辨率：7680 x 4320 像素 2. 帧率（Frame Rate） 帧率决定了每秒钟显示的图片数量。常见的帧率有：\n24 fps（电影级别） 30 fps（常见的电视内容） 60 fps（高帧率内容，如体育赛事） 3. 颜色深度（Color Depth） 颜色深度决定了每个像素的颜色信息。常见的颜色深度有：\n8-bit：每个颜色通道（红、绿、蓝）8-bit，共计24-bit 10-bit：每个颜色通道10-bit，共计30-bit 12-bit：每个颜色通道12-bit，共计36-bit 4. 颜色子采样（Chroma Subsampling） 颜色子采样影响每个像素的颜色信息存储量。常见模式有：\n4:4:4：没有子采样，每个像素都有完整的颜色信息。 4:2:2：水平分辨率上颜色分量减半。 4:2:0：水平和垂直分辨率上颜色分量减半。 5. 是否使用HDR HDR会增加颜色信息量和亮度范围，通常使用更高的颜色深度（10-bit或12-bit）以及更高的动态范围。\n6. 计算步骤 6.1 像素总数 4K分辨率：3840 x 2160 = 8,294,400 像素 8K分辨率：7680 x 4320 = 33,177,600 像素 6.2 每帧数据量计算 [ \\text{每帧数据量} = \\text{像素总数} \\times \\text{颜色深度} \\times \\text{颜色子采样因子} ]\n假设使用4:4:4采样：\n8-bit颜色深度：24-bit（3个8-bit通道） 10-bit颜色深度：30-bit（3个10-bit通道） 12-bit颜色深度：36-bit（3个12-bit通道） [ \\text{每帧数据量 (bit)} = \\text{像素总数} \\times \\text{颜色深度 (bit)} ]\n6.3 每秒数据量计算 [ \\text{每秒数据量 (bit)} = \\text{每帧数据量 (bit)} \\times \\text{帧率} ]\n6.4 带宽计算 带宽通常以Mbps（每秒百万位）为单位： [ \\text{带宽 (Mbps)} = \\frac{\\text{每秒数据量 (bit)}}{1,000,000} ]\n7. 实例计算 7.1 4K 60fps, 10-bit, 4:4:4, SDR 像素总数：8,294,400 每帧数据量：8,294,400 像素 x 30-bit = 248,832,000 bit = 248.83 Mb 每秒数据量：248.83 Mb x 60 = 14,929.8 Mbps 7.2 8K 60fps, 10-bit, 4:4:4, SDR 像素总数：33,177,600 每帧数据量：33,177,600 像素 x 30-bit = 995,328,000 bit = 995.33 Mb 每秒数据量：995.33 Mb x 60 = 59,719.8 Mbps 7.3 带HDR的计算（以12-bit为例） 4K 60fps, 12-bit, 4:4:4, HDR：(\\text{每秒数据量 (bit)}) = ( 8,294,400 \\times 36 \\times 60 = 17,917.44 \\text{Mbps} ) 8K 60fps, 12-bit, 4:4:4, HDR：(\\text{每秒数据量 (bit)}) = ( 33,177,600 \\times 36 \\times 60 = 71,669.76 \\text{Mbps} ) 8. 总结 SDR和HDR的主要区别在于颜色深度，HDR通常使用更高的颜色深度，这增加了带宽需求。 颜色子采样从4:4:4降低到4:2:2或4:2:0可以大大减少带宽需求。 在实际应用中，视频编码（如H.264, H.265）通常会大幅压缩数据量，因此实际带宽需求会比未压缩视频计算出的值低很多。 通过理解这些步骤，可以根据特定的需求计算不同分辨率、帧率、颜色深度和动态范围的视频带宽需求。\n","categories":["News"],"description":"","excerpt":"AI挑战广电行业jjjjjjj天啊!斤斤计较 NVIDIA\n这篇文章够新，也提出未来的方向，所以我借鉴了。 重要记录：\nHDR 8K 虚拟人物-虚幻引擎 SDI将会被淘汰，IP流传输会取而代之

setContextProperty：将 C++ 对象 (class_opts) 设置为 QML 上下文属性，使 QML 可以访问这个对象。 engine.load(url)：加载指定的 QML 文件并显示其界面。 if (engine.rootObjects().isEmpty()) { return -1; } rootObjects()：获取 QML 引擎中加载的根对象。如果根对象为空，说明 QML 文件加载失败，程序返回 -1 退出。 return glb_GUI_app.exec(); } GUI_app.exec()：启动应用程序的事件循环。这个方法会阻塞，直到应用程序退出。它处理所有的用户输入、定时器事件等。 总结 设置属性：设置 Qt 应用程序的属性来使用软件渲染 OpenGL。 设置环境：调用自定义函数来配置 Qt 环境。 创建应用程序对象：QGuiApplication 处理 GUI 相关任务。 设置图标：检查并设置应用程序窗口图标。 创建 QML 引擎：用于加载和管理 QML 文件。 创建和设置 C++ 对象：将 C++ 对象暴露给 QML。 连接信号和槽：确保 QML 文件正确加载。 设置导入路径：为 QML 引擎添加模块导入路径。 加载 QML 文件：实际加载并显示 QML 界面。 启动事件循环：进入事件循环，处理应用程序事件。 这个 main 函数展示了如何在 Qt 中设置应用程序图标、加载 QML 界面，并将 C++ 对象暴露给 QML，同时确保应用程序在启动时能够正确处理潜在的错误。\n暴露整个类对象给QML的意义何在？ 暴露整个 C++ 类的对象给 QML 主要有以下几个目的和考虑，但这些目的在不同的场景下可能有不同的实现方式，因此也需要根据实际需求来选择是否采用 Q_PROPERTY 或其他方式。\n1. 访问复杂逻辑或功能： 如果你有一个复杂的 C++ 类，这个类封装了一些业务逻辑、算法或功能（例如网络请求、数据处理、硬件交互等），你可以通过暴露整个对象给 QML，让 QML 层能够调用这个对象的方法。这些方法可能不只是简单的数据访问，还包括一些逻辑操作，比如计算、状态管理等。 在这种情况下，QML 通过调用 C++ 对象的方法，可以利用 C++ 的强大功能，弥补 QML 本身的能力不足。例如，执行某些复杂的操作，然后将结果返回给 QML。 2. 共享和管理状态： 如果你的 C++ 类管理了一些全局或共享状态（例如应用程序的配置、运行状态、数据缓存等），暴露这个对象给 QML 可以让 QML 访问和操作这些状态。在这种情况下，暴露整个对象可以简化在多个 QML 组件之间共享数据或状态的需求。 3. 整合 C++ 和 QML 的开发： 在某些项目中，可能需要将 C++ 层的功能和 QML 层的 UI 进行紧密整合。暴露整个 C++ 类的对象可以减少接口设计的复杂性，使得 QML 可以直接利用 C++ 层的现有代码，不需要重复定义接口或桥接代码。 4. 使用单例模式的好处： 如果你使用单例模式暴露 C++ 对象，那么这个对象在整个应用程序中只有一个实例。这在某些情况下很有用，比如你希望确保某些数据或状态在应用程序的所有部分中保持一致。这种方式常用于全局管理器类（如设置管理器、数据库连接管理器等），这些类的实例通常只有一个，且在应用程序的整个生命周期内都存在。 5. Q_PROPERTY 的作用： 如果你仅仅暴露整个 C++ 对象而不使用 Q_PROPERTY，那么 QML 层可能无法直接访问对象的属性，尤其是私有或受保护的成员变量。Q_PROPERTY 的作用在于允许 QML 层将某些 C++ 属性作为 QML 属性来使用，使得这些属性可以直接在 QML 中绑定、显示，并在值变化时自动触发更新。 另一方面，如果你不使用 Q_PROPERTY，但仍然希望 QML 能访问到某些公有数据，你可能需要手动定义 getter 和 setter 方法，然后在 QML 中通过调用这些方法来获取或设置数据。然而，这种方式无法实现自动数据同步，且代码更为冗长。 总结： 暴露整个 C++ 对象给 QML 的意义在于允许 QML 层访问和调用这个对象所提供的功能和方法，而不仅仅是访问简单的数据。如果只是为了访问某个数据属性，Q_PROPERTY 是更好的选择，它不仅可以简化代码，还能实现数据的自动同步更新。\n如果你发现暴露整个类对象对于你的需求并不合适或不方便，那么你可以选择只暴露必要的功能和属性（例如通过 Q_PROPERTY），这样可以确保代码的清晰性和维护性。选择合适的方式取决于你的具体应用场景和需求。\n","categories":["blog","Qt

Current pressedButtons:\", titleMouseArea.pressedButtons) } } the solution is a logic control that when i click left button, onPressed set the flag variable TRUE, and if i do not move the cursor away, the onRelease slot will set the flag variable to FALSE.

Window import QtQuick 6.2 import QtQuick.Window 6.2 Window { visible: true width: 800 height: 600 title: \"Window Example\" } 3.

Item import QtQuick 6.2 Item { width: 800 height: 600 Rectangle { width: 100 height: 100 color: \"blue\" } } 6. Rectangle import QtQuick 6.2 Rectangle { width: 800 height: 600 color: \"lightgray\" Text { anchors.centerIn: parent text: \"Rectangle Example\" } } 7. Application import QtQuick 6.2 Application { id: app Item { width: 800 height: 600 Rectangle { width: 100 height: 100 color: \"blue\" } } } 顶层容器结构 顶层容器的结构通常如下：\nApplication 或 ApplicationWindow 或 Window 或 Dialog 或 Popup\r子元素：Item, Rectangle, Text, Button, ListView 等各种 UI 元素\r示例： ApplicationWindow { visible: true width: 800 height: 600 title: \"App Structure Example\" Rectangle { width: parent.width height: parent.height color: \"lightgray\" Text { anchors.centerIn: parent text: \"Hello, World!\" } } } 这些顶层容器类型及其结构可以根据具体需求选择和使用，从而满足不同类型的应用程序设计需求。\n关键字：Property 让我们深入探讨一下 QML 中 property 的作用、外部访问的机制，以及如何决定属性是否暴露给外部。\n1. QML 中的属性访问机制 内置属性（如 height、width 等） 内置属性：QML 中的某些属性，如 height、width、color 等，是组件自带的内置属性，这些属性默认是对外暴露的。因此，父组件可以直接访问和设置这些属性。\n访问方式：这些内置属性在定义组件时自动提供，可以直接通过组件的 id 在外部访问，例如：\nRectangle { id: rect width: 100 height: 50 } Item { width: rect.width // 直接访问 rect 的 width 属性 } 2. property 的作用 定义自定义属性 扩展属性：通过 property，你可以定义组件的自定义属性，这些属性不是组件的内置属性。property 使得这些自定义属性能够被外部访问和修改。例如，你可能会定义一个 property 来跟踪某个状态： Rectangle { id: rect property int myCustomHeight: 100 } Item { width: rect.myCustomHeight // 访问自定义的 myCustomHeight 属性 } 绑定和初始值 属性绑定：property 可以与其他属性或表达式绑定，这使得属性之间能够自动更新。例如： Rectangle { id: rect property int myCustomHeight: width / 2 // myCustomHeight 随着 width 的变化而变化 width: 200 } 暴露内部状态 状态管理：你可以通过 property 把组件的内部状态暴露给外部，从而实现更好的封装和模块化设计。例如，定义一个 property 来暴露内部的计算结果： Rectangle { id: rect property real area: width * height // 暴露矩形的面积 } 3. 内部变量与 property 的区别 局部变量：如果你只需要在组件内部使用某个值或状态，通常不会使用 property，而是使用局部变量或 JavaScript 变量。局部变量不会暴露给外部，也不会通过 id 访问到。\n局部变量示例： Rectangle { id: rect width: 100 height: 50 var internalValue = 200 // 只在这个组件内部可见的变量 } property 的作用：property 主要用于定义和管理组件的外部可见状态或配置。通过 property，你可以把组件的某些内部状态暴露出来，供父组件或外部组件访问。\n4. 总结：property 的功能与外部访问 外部访问：内置属性（如 height、width）默认是暴露给外部的，而通过 property 定义的属性也会暴露给外部。没有 property 修饰的局部变量则不会被外部访问到。\nproperty 的用途：property 主要用于定义组件的自定义属性、管理属性绑定、或暴露内部状态给外部。property 还允许你为自定义属性设置初始值，并支持动态绑定。\n局部变量 vs property：如果你不希望某个状态或值被外部访问，且只需要在组件内部使用，那么应使用局部变量或 JavaScript 变量，而不是 property。property 用于那些需要外部访问和管理的属性。\n通过理解这些概念，你可以更好地设计和组织 QML 代码，确保组件之间的低耦合性和良好的封装性。\n003.Singleton 单例对象 使用场景 可以是要在外部动态的设置某一个程序的属性，让整个程序的其他组件都因此做出改变，可以用singleton\nQML Styling 及 Singleton 使用方法浅谈 - 掘金\n希望精简，模块不要反复被创建\n【必要步骤】在相应的qml文件的顶行写pragma Singleton pragma Singleton 注意这条语句要写在import 语句之前\n【必要步骤】需要在相应的CMakeList.txt里设置QT_QML_SINGLETON_TYPE 为TRUE set_source_files_properties(First_Color_Scheme.qml PROPERTIES QT_QML_SINGLETON_TYPE TRUE ) 在哪一个CMakeList.txt呢？\n我的qml文件处在项目根目录下的一个叫content的文件夹中\n这个文件夹是专门存放所有qml文件的\n在content下有一个CMakeList.txt\n（不要放到项目根目录下的CMakeList.txt里面-因为放进去也没用）\n设置完会怎么样，请看build之后的目录下：\nbuild\\6_5_3_MSVC2019_x64-Debug\\qml\\content\\qmldir\n设置技巧\n本语句的位置不能低于qt6_add_qml_module（或qt_add_qml_module）\n【必要步骤】需要在相应的CMakeList.txt里创建单例模块Singleton Module（独立于其他QML模块） CMakeLists.txt的相关代码 qt6_add_qml_module(singleton URI \"singleton\" VERSION 1.0 QML_FILES Color/First_Color_Scheme.qml ) 这里的URI很重要，最后我们要调用的地方，都需要import，而import后面的模块名称就是看URI的。\n为什么一定要再这里创建单例模块呢？ 按照微软的文档：\n我们就是需要去把它做成一个模块的\n【必要步骤】调用singleton object（单例对象）的办法 不能用的办法1：创建它\n代码\nSecond_TitleBar { id: bID_Instance_Module_TitleBar anchors.top: parent.top width: parent.width } 例如这种方法，就是去创建一个单例对象，这样会提示错误\n错误信息\n11:00:01: Starting C:\\Code\\ASCtl\\PL\\QtProj\\build\\6_5_3_MSVC2019_x64-Debug\\ASCtl_UIApp.exe...

How to fix it. Date: Aug07.2024\nLNK: hugo server intro page\nBy default hugo will also watch your files for any changes you make and automatically rebuild the site. It will then live reload any open browser pages and push the latest content to them.

Problem but when i edited my files via volume of docker which shared from host to guest os and the host os is windows 10 and the guest os is ubuntu 22.04, nothing will happen anyway.\n``the solution which comes from ChatGPT-4o` The issue you are encountering with Hugo not detecting file changes in a Docker volume shared directory could be related to how Docker and WSL handle file system notifications. Here are some steps you can try to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\nCheck File System Notifications: Ensure that file system notifications are correctly set up in your Docker container. Sometimes, the way Docker handles file changes in volumes can cause issues with live reload.\nUse Polling for File Changes: You can configure Hugo to use polling instead of relying on file system notifications. This can be done by setting the --poll flag when running the Hugo server. For example:\nhugo server --poll 300ms This will make Hugo poll for changes every 300 milliseconds.\nVerify Volume Mount Options: Ensure that your Docker volume mount options are set correctly. You can specify the :cached option to improve performance:\ndocker run -v /path/to/your/hugo/project:/src:cached -p 1313:1313 klakegg/hugo server Check Docker and WSL Versions: Make sure you are using the latest versions of Docker Desktop and WSL. Updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements.\nRestart Docker and WSL: Sometimes, simply restarting Docker and WSL can resolve issues with file change detection.\nCheck Docker Logs: Look at the Docker container logs to see if there are any errors or warnings related to file system notifications or Hugo server.\nTest Outside Docker: As a troubleshooting step, try running Hugo directly on your Windows machine or in a native Ubuntu installation (not within Docker) to see if the issue persists.\nHere is an example Docker command with the polling option:\ndocker run --rm -it -v /path/to/your/hugo/project:/src -p 1313:1313 klakegg/hugo server --poll 300ms By trying these steps, you should be able to determine whether the issue is with Docker's handling of file changes or something else in your setup. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!\nfinal ... hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 1313 --disableFastRender --poll 1000ms ... this fixed my problem!\n003.

#endif UUID为什么有中间的“-”连字符\rUUID（Universally Unique Identifier）或 GUID（Globally Unique Identifier）中使用连字符（`-`）是为了增加可读性和标准化。虽然连字符没有任何技术上的必要性，但它们有助于分隔和识别 UUID 的不同部分。\rUUID 格式 一个标准的 UUID 格式为 8-4-4-4-12，即总共 32 个十六进制字符分为五个部分，每个部分用连字符分隔。这种格式定义在 RFC 4122 中。\n例如：\n$$BCDE0395-E52F-467C-8E3D-C4579291692E$$格式的分隔意义 时间戳部分（8个字符）：UUID 的前 8 个字符通常表示时间戳的高位部分。 时间戳的中间部分（4个字符）：接下来的 4 个字符表示时间戳的中间部分。 时间戳的低位部分和版本号（4个字符）：接下来的 4 个字符表示时间戳的低位部分和版本号。 时钟序列（4个字符）：接下来的 4 个字符表示时钟序列。 节点（12个字符）：最后的 12 个字符表示节点信息（通常是基于网络地址）。 这种分隔方式有助于解析和理解 UUID 的不同部分，并确保它们的唯一性。\n使用连字符的好处 可读性：连字符使得 UUID 更加可读，更容易分辨和检查。 标准化：按照 RFC 4122 标准定义的格式，有助于在不同系统和平台之间保持一致性。 解析和验证：连字符分隔使得解析和验证 UUID 更加简单和明确。 无连字符表示 在一些情况下，可以去掉连字符并连续地写下所有字符。例如：\n$$BCDE0395E52F467C8E3DC4579291692E$$这种形式在某些编程语言和库中也是支持的，但为了确保一致性和标准化，通常还是建议使用带有连字符的格式。\n总结 连字符的作用：主要是增加可读性和标准化。 UUID 格式：8-4-4-4-12 的格式有助于分隔和识别不同的部分。 使用连字符的好处：使得 UUID 更加可读、标准化，便于解析和验证。 尽管技术上可以省略连字符，但使用标准格式带来的可读性和一致性优势使得它成为惯用的做法。\n/* * guiddef.h */ #define REFCLSID const IID \u0026 (2/5)[in] pUnkOuter If NULL, indicates that the object is not being created as part of an aggregate.\rIf non-NULL, pointer to the aggregate object's IUnknown interface (the controlling IUnknown).\r关于Aggregate，更详尽的解释-FromGpt4o\r在 `CoCreateInstance` 函数中，第二个参数 `pUnkOuter` 是一个指向 `IUnknown` 接口的指针，通常用于支持 COM 对象的聚合。聚合是 COM 中的一种技术，允许一个对象（外部对象）包含另一个对象（内部对象），并使内部对象的接口看起来像是外部对象的一部分。\r参数详细解释 HRESULT CoCreateInstance( REFCLSID rclsid, // Class identifier (CLSID) of the object to be created LPUNKNOWN pUnkOuter, // Pointer to controlling IUnknown (for aggregation) DWORD dwClsContext, // Context in which the code that manages the newly created object will run REFIID riid, // Interface identifier (IID) of the interface to be used to communicate with the object LPVOID *ppv // Address of pointer variable that receives the interface pointer requested in riid ); pUnkOuter 参数 pUnkOuter：指向控制未知接口（IUnknown）的指针。如果不使用聚合，则传递 NULL。在聚合的情况下，pUnkOuter 应该是外部对象的 IUnknown 指针。 聚合（Aggregation） 聚合是一种将一个对象嵌入到另一个对象中的机制，使得内部对象的接口对外部对象的客户端透明。聚合在以下情况下有用：\n对象组合：允许组合对象共享一个公共的 IUnknown 接口，从而表现为一个单一对象。 对象封装：允许一个对象封装另一个对象，并公开其接口，而不暴露内部实现细节。 聚合的使用 当你使用聚合时，外部对象将包含内部对象，并通过内部对象的接口来实现外部对象的部分功能。在这种情况下，CoCreateInstance 的第二个参数 pUnkOuter 将指向外部对象的 IUnknown 接口，以便内部对象可以调用外部对象的接口。\n如果你不使用聚合，则将 pUnkOuter 设置为 NULL，表示不进行聚合。\n示例代码 不使用聚合 IMMDeviceEnumerator* deviceEnumerator = NULL; HRESULT hr = CoCreateInstance( __uuidof(MMDeviceEnumerator), // CLSID NULL, // pUnkOuter (no aggregation) CLSCTX_ALL, // Context __uuidof(IMMDeviceEnumerator), // IID (void**)\u0026deviceEnumerator // Interface pointer ); 在这个例子中，pUnkOuter 被设置为 NULL，表示不使用聚合。\n使用聚合 假设你有一个类 COuter，它希望包含一个内部对象 CInner：\nclass COuter : public IUnknown { public: // Implement IUnknown methods HRESULT QueryInterface(REFIID riid, void** ppv) { if (riid == IID_IUnknown) { *ppv = static_cast\u003cIUnknown*\u003e(this); AddRef(); return S_OK; } // Handle other interfaces return E_NOINTERFACE; } ULONG AddRef() { return InterlockedIncrement(\u0026m_refCount); } ULONG Release() { ULONG count = InterlockedDecrement(\u0026m_refCount); if (count == 0) { delete this; } return count; } private: ULONG m_refCount; }; // Create an instance of COuter and aggregate CInner COuter* pOuter = new COuter(); IUnknown* pUnkOuter = static_cast\u003cIUnknown*\u003e(pOuter); CInner* pInner = NULL; HRESULT hr = CoCreateInstance( CLSID_CInner, // CLSID of the inner object pUnkOuter, // pUnkOuter (aggregation) CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, // Context IID_IUnknown, // IID of the interface (void**)\u0026pInner // Interface pointer ); if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) { // Use pInner } 在这个例子中，pUnkOuter 被设置为外部对象的 IUnknown 指针，以便内部对象可以进行聚合。\n总结 pUnkOuter 是一个指向 IUnknown 接口的指针，用于支持聚合。 聚合 允许一个对象包含另一个对象，并使内部对象的接口对外部对象的客户端透明。 如果不使用聚合，则将 pUnkOuter 设置为 NULL。 通过理解 pUnkOuter 参数的用途和聚合的概念，可以更好地理解和使用 COM 编程模型中的聚合特性。\n(3/5)[in] dwClsContext\nContext in which the code that manages the newly created object will run.\rThe values are taken from the enumeration CLSCTX.\rdwClsContext: dw=double world;(microsofts naming style)\u003c/br\u003e\r\u0026emsp;Cls=Class;

大型企业：从业人员超过1000人，营业收入超过4亿元。 建筑业 微型企业：从业人员少于50人，营业收入少于300万元。 小型企业：从业人员50-300人，营业收入300万-3000万元。 中型企业：从业人员300-3000人，营业收入3000万-2亿元。 大型企业：从业人员超过3000人，营业收入超过2亿元。 国际标准 国际上，企业规模的划分也有不同的标准。例如：\n欧盟标准 欧盟对中小企业的定义主要依据《中小企业定义指南》：\n微型企业：员工少于10人，年营业额或资产总额不超过200万欧元。 小型企业：员工少于50人，年营业额或资产总额不超过1000万欧元。 中型企业：员工少于250人，年营业额不超过5000万欧元或资产总额不超过4300万欧元。 美国标准

These plans offer a feature called Stealth Mode, which allows you to keep your generated images private by using the `/stealth` command. This feature ensures that your images will not be visible to others on the MidJourney website as long as you generate them in private Discord channels or direct messages.\rIt's important to note that even in Stealth Mode, images generated in public Discord channels will still be visible to other users in those channels. To fully utilise Stealth Mode, you should generate images in private settings. Furthermore, if you cancel or downgrade your subscription, any previously created Stealth Mode images will remain unpublished and private【7†source】【8†source】【9†source】.\r- 痛点2-关于共享 - 你再帮我查询mj的官方资料，如果我建立一个私人的server，我的subscription可否供给整个群友使用。\r根据MidJourney的官方资料，如果你建立一个私人服务器，并将MidJourney机器人添加到该服务器上，你的订阅仍然是个人使用的，并不能直接共享给整个群友使用。每位用户在你的服务器中使用MidJourney机器人时，都需要有自己单独的订阅【16†source】【17†source】。\r不过，MidJourney确实提供了一种**“房间”功能**，允许你创建一个私密的房间，并与朋友分享这个房间的链接和密码。在这个房间内，你和你的朋友可以一起创建图像【19†source】。尽管如此，每个参与的用户仍需要有自己的MidJourney订阅，才能在这个私密房间中使用MidJourney机器人。\r另外，MidJourney的图像生成默认是公开的，包括在私人服务器中生成的图像。如果你想要保持图像的私密性，只有订阅Pro计划（每月60美元）或Mega计划（每月120美元），并使用/stealth命令，才能开启隐身模式，确保图像不被公开【15†source】【16†source】。\r总结：\r1. 你无法通过建立私人服务器将你的MidJourney订阅分享给整个群友使用。\r2. 每位用户都需要拥有自己的MidJourney订阅。\r3. 默认情况下，所有生成的图像都是公开的，除非你使用Pro或Mega订阅并启用隐身模式。\r更多信息可以访问MidJourney的官方文档和帮助页面：[MidJourney帮助中心](https://help.midjourney.com/en/)。\r- 痛点3-关于API接入 - gpt4o-jun13.2024\rMidJourney currently does not offer API access for external integration. Users interact with MidJourney through Discord, either within the MidJourney official server or on private servers where the MidJourney Bot has been added.MidJourney 目前不提供用于外部集成的 API 访问。用户通过 Discord 与 MidJourney 进行交互，无论是在 MidJourney 官方服务器内还是在添加了 MidJourney Bot 的私人服务器上。\rRegarding creating private rooms or servers for collaborative image generation:关于创建用于协作图像生成的私人房间或服务器：\r1. **Private Rooms:** MidJourney allows users to create private rooms where they can invite friends to collaborate. However, each participant must have their own MidJourney subscription to use the bot in these rooms.\r私人房间：MidJourney 允许用户创建私人房间，他们可以邀请朋友进行协作。但是，每个参与者必须拥有自己的 MidJourney 订阅才能在这些房间中使用机器人。\r2. **Private Servers:** If you create a private Discord server and invite the MidJourney Bot, the images generated there will still be visible on MidJourney's website unless generated in Stealth Mode, which requires a Pro subscription. Each user on the private server must also have their own subscription to generate images.\r私人服务器：如果您创建私人 Discord 服务器并邀请 MidJourney 机器人，则那里生成的图像仍将在 MidJourney 的网站上可见，除非在隐身模式下生成，这需要 Pro 订阅。专用服务器上的每个用户还必须有自己的订阅才能生成图像。\rFree plan users do not count as having a subscription; they have limited capabilities and cannot access some features available to paid subscribers, such as the Stealth Mode.免费计划用户不算作订阅；他们的功能有限，无法访问付费订阅者可用的某些功能，例如隐形模式。\rTo manage or add the MidJourney Bot to a server:要管理 MidJourney 机器人或将 MidJourney 机器人添加到服务器：\r- Invite the MidJourney Bot from the [MidJourney website](https://www.midjourney.com/) or through Discord's app directory.\r从 MidJourney 网站或通过 Discord 的应用程序目录邀请 MidJourney 机器人。\r- Follow the instructions to authorize and add the bot to your desired server.\r按照说明授权机器人并将其添加到您所需的服务器。\r- You can restrict the bot’s usage to specific channels by modifying channel permissions.\r您可以通过修改频道权限来限制机器人对特定频道的使用。\rFor direct messages with the MidJourney Bot:对于使用 MidJourney 机器人的直接消息：\r- Direct message the bot within Discord to generate images. These images are also publicly visible unless generated in Stealth Mode.\r直接向 Discord 中的机器人发送消息以生成图像。除非以隐身模式生成，否则这些图像也是公开可见的。\rFor detailed information, you can refer to the [MidJourney Quick Start Guide](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quick-start) and the [MidJourney Bot Management](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/add-the-bot) pages.有关详细信息，您可以参阅 MidJourney 快速入门指南和 MidJourney 机器人管理页面。\r- 02.
